# Odin_Project_Recipes
 This is a project from theodinproject.com called Recipes.
 This will be a basic recipe website to practice my html knowledge and get a better grasp of writing html and creating web pages.
 It wasn't supposed to be anything pretty but I decided to do a whole lot more than was asked and added a ton of css while learning new css properties and also used some javascript on the project to create some pop-ups and works with a form.
