    <h2 class="subtitles"><b>Description</b></h2>
    <p id="recipe-description">
        Margherita pizza is a thin-crust Naples-style pizza topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil leaves, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. It's easy to make at home, and you don't need a fancy oven or even a pizza stone to get pizzeria-quality results. I use a rich homemade pizza dough, a blazing hot oven, and a sheet pan to produce a crisp yet chewy pizza crust. The sauce is a speedy, no-cook Neapolitan pizza sauce made from canned San Marzano tomatoes; it has vibrant tomato flavor, and you can whip it up in 5 minutes.
        
        <br><br>Because the recipe is so simple, it's important to use high-quality ingredients and approach them with a light hand. I know it's tempting to load up on toppings, but less is definitely more here; too much sauce and cheese will make the pizza soggy. Pair these pizzas with a simple arugula salad and dinner is done!

    <h2 class="subtitiles">Necessary Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Homemade pizza dough</li>
        <li>San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh mozzarella ball</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitles">All of the steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce by combining the crushed tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and sugar in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, using your hands, stretch and press one ball of dough into an 11-inch round.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet, and gently stretch it out again so that it maintains its shape.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons of the sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 7 minutes, until the crust is partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and scatter half of the mozzarella cubes over the sauce, followed by half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li>
        <li>Slide the pan back into the oven and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 4 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with the basil and slice.</li>
    </ol>
