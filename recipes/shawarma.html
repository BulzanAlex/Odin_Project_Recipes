            This Chicken Shawarma recipe is going to knock your socks off!
             Just a handful of every day spices makes an incredible Chicken Shawarma marinade that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. The smell when this is cooking is insane!
            <br>
            Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It's a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates.
              But don't worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ!
