            This Chicken Shawarma recipe is going to knock your socks off!
             Just a handful of every day spices makes an incredible Chicken Shawarma marinade that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. The smell when this is cooking is insane!
            <br>
            Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It's a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates.
              But don't worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ!

            For the best results, it's best to marinate the chicken overnight. But to be honest, the volume and flavour of the marinade is intense enough that you can get away with a minimum of 3 hours of marinating.

            <li>Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air, then massage to coat from the outside.</li>
            <li>Yogurt sauce - Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the flavours meld.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ.</li>
            <li>Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh.</li>
